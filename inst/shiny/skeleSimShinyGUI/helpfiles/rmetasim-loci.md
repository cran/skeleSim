Rmetasim allows you to specify the number of alleles at each locus as
well as their frequencies.  As the number of loci grows, it becomes
inconvenient to type all of these numbers in.  As a result, skeleSim
allows you to select an overall "alleles per locus" number.  After
selecting, pushing the *Replace number of alleles across all loci..*
button copies this number of alleles to all the loci specified.
