The *Read skelesim object from file* button lets you find an existing
skelesim object stored on your local disk and load it into the
skelesim environment.  This object can be inspected and edited, and if it contains an already-run simulation the simulation results can be visualized on the **Results** tab

The *Save skelesim object to file* button can be used to to save a partially or fully completed skeleSim object for editing or simulating later.
